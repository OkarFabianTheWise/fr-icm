# **Fiatrouter Pitch Deck**

## **The Problem**

- Holding tokens or stocks without a strategy is risky and unproductive.
- Most people don’t know how to trade or allocate capital wisely.
- Market volatility causes panic, missed opportunities, and long-term underperformance.

---

## **Our Vision**

### **Fiatrouter — Gateway to the Internet Capital Markets (ICM)**

> We unlock high-performance, on-chain financial products for the next generation of investors.
> From real-world stocks like **Tesla (xTSLA)** and **Circle (xCRLC)** to tokenized yield strategies — all in one seamless platform.

---

## **Our Solution**

- **Fiatrouter Pools**: AI-enhanced, creator-led investment buckets built on ICM.
- Creators define strategies across ICM assets (tokens, xStocks, xCRLC).
- Anyone can join a creator’s pool to earn — **no expertise needed**.
- Automated capital allocation and built-in risk controls ensure better outcomes.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Create**
   A vetted creator sets up an investment pool (“bucket”) using ICM assets:

   - Tokens
   - Tokenized stocks (e.g., xTSLA, xCRLC)
   - Yield strategies

2. **Raise**
   Contributors deposit capital into the bucket — together, they fund the strategy.

3. **Trade & Allocate**

   - **50%** actively traded by the creator
   - **20%** deployed into on-chain yield sources (e.g., Meteora)
   - **30%** reserved for protection & stability

4. **Own via NFTs**
   Each contributor gets an **NFT receipt** — proof of stake and access to profit claim.

5. **Claim**
   After the trade cycle, profits are distributed proportionally to contributors.
