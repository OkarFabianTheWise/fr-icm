## 🏦 **Fiatrouter Rebrand: Seamless, Non-Custodial Access to Internet Capital Markets**

**Built for Africans. Runs on Rust. Powered by Strategy.**

---

### 🌍 **Vision**

Give everyday Nigerians/Africans access to real capital market opportunities (ETFs, stocks) without needing to learn complex financial tools or lose custody of their money.

---

### 🔑 **Core Principles**

* **Trust**: User funds always stay in **their own wallets** (non-custodial).
* **Simplicity**: Easy onboarding via Naira or USDC.
* **Automation**: Let bots handle performance, exposure, and profit-taking.
* **Local-first**: Build for **Africa**, scale globally.
* **Self-Sustaining**: No external funding — system must generate profit.

---

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

* **Backend**: Rust (performance, low-cost, concurrency, and safety)
* **Frontend**: Lightweight widget-based interface, embeddable anywhere
* **Compute**: Server-side agent trading + real-time PnL tracking
* **Wallets**: USDC, USDCg, Naira onramp/offramp integrations

---

## 🧱 **Core Components**

### 1. 🌀 Swap Engine

> **Turns user currency into ETF exposure — quickly, cheaply, transparently.**

* Accepts Naira or USDC
* Converts to ETF/stocks based on selected portfolio or strategy
* Uses onchain/offchain price aggregation and routing
* Takes swap fee (primary revenue stream)
* If user lacks funds, triggers **onramp** or wallet prompt
* Converts back (exit) using same routing system

---

### 2. 🧳 Portfolio Creator & Tracker

> **Simple tools to build, share, and follow portfolio strategies.**

* Create a "Bag" (Portfolio) with ETF + Stock asset allocation
* Users can add/remove assets (curated list only)
* **PnL is tracked** live and historically, on a per-asset and per-portfolio level
* Leaderboard shows performance across creators
* Auto generates **feed items** for strategy actions and wins
* Enables users to **join or clone** strategies easily
* Designed to **support funding from other users** into successful strategies

---

### 3. 🤖 ETF Bot Trading Engine (Agent Model)

> **Your strategy runs itself — powered by Rust logic on the server.**

* Each ETF strategy is linked to a Rust-based trading agent
* Agent reads price signals, volume, volatility, and executes buys/sells
* Supports:

  * Dollar-cost averaging
  * Rebalancing
  * Trend-following or AI-based signals (future)
* Can act as **LP**, enter arbitrage opportunities between ETFs
* Takes performance fee on exit or rebalancing win
* Tracks each execution and shares report back to user feed

---

### 4. 📊 Leaderboard & Performance Feed

> **Make investing social and competitive — but smart.**

* Leaderboard ranks portfolios based on:

  * Realized PnL
  * Stability (Sharpe, drawdown)
  * Sector performance (e.g. Gaming, Green Energy)
* Each “Bag” has a page with:

  * Allocations
  * Win/loss feed
  * Join/fund buttons
* Feeds are auto-generated by portfolio performance or agent trade events

---

### 5. 💸 Onramp & Offramp Engine

> **Handles fiat entry/exit — abstracted for end-user simplicity.**

* Naira → USDC (via integrated third-party APIs)
* Offramp (USDC → Naira) when user exits portfolio
* Swaps layered with ETF transactions so user never sees complexity
* Fees taken per movement
* Compliance layer tied to limits + ID requirements (talk to Alex)

## 📈 **Revenue Model**

| Revenue Source       | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Swap Fees**        | Each Naira→USDC or USDC→ETF swap charges a % fee       |
| **Performance Fees** | Fee on profits made by ETF bot trading/portfolio exits |
| **Arbitrage Yield**  | Agents take small profit on price spread trading       |
| **Exposure Boost**   | Pay to promote portfolio in leaderboard/feed           |

---

## 🚀 **Go-To-Market Plan**

* Start with Nigeria-only launch
* Run ETF Trading Contests (top-performing portfolios)
* Create sectors (Gaming, Tech, Food) → attach narratives users understand
* Promote wallet-based access (non-custodial trust)
* Run early growth from swap + performance sharing via social

---

## 🎯 **User Journey Flow**

```
1. Land on Widget > Choose a Portfolio (Gaming ETF, for example)
2. Swap Naira or USDC → ETF Bag (via Swap Engine)
3. Agent manages trades in background
4. User checks PnL, sees performance in Feed
5. Leaderboard highlights performance
6. Other users fund same portfolio → Fees generated
7. User exits > Offramp to Naira > Fee taken
```

---

## 🧠 **Design Philosophy**

* **No overbuilding** – UI is light, logic is server-side
* **Rust-first** for scalable, low-latency agent execution
* **Revenue-first** – make money early, skip fundraising
* **Clean financial narrative** – no crypto hype, just exposure and returns

## 🧩 **Next Steps (Prioritized)**

1. ✅ Sketch high-level **architecture diagram**
2. ✅ Define data flows for swap ↔ portfolio ↔ agent
3. ⏳ Talk to Alex (compliance, license, fiat handling)
4. 🚧 Build Swap Engine prototype (Rust + API layer)
5. 🚧 Build Portfolio Tracker
6. 🚧 Start Agent Trading system (Rust microservice model)
